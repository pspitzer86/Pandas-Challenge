# Pandas-Video-Game-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analysis purchasing data for popular fictional game, HeroesofPymoli.  By reorganizing the data in several different ways, we can determine various trends in the actions of the players based on the gender of players, age of the players, and the kinds of items and amount of items brought by the players.  The project focused on the use of Pandas dataframes, methods such as mean and sum, groupbys, cutting and sorting data, and binning.  The code created was used to show output dataframes for the Total Number of Players, the overall Purchasing Analysis, the Gender Demographic, the Purchasing Analysis based on Gender, the Age Demographic, the Purchasing Analysis based on Age, the Top Spenders, the Most Popular Items, and the Most Profitable Items.

Heroes of Pymoli Observations: Three Conclusions from the Data

One conclusion to be drawn from the data for this analysis is that the players spending the most money are male.  This makes sense in that the majority of the players of this game are male.  The style of the game and the items sold may appeal more to the male crowd accounting for the abundance of male players.

Another conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that the majority of those playing the game are within the 20-24 Age Group.  As well as attracting male players, the games style and the items being sold in the game appeal to the young adult finishing up their college career and entering the working world.

Those within the 20-24 Age Group also account for the most money spent on the items in this game.  Since the majority of these players are starting to earn their own money in the working world and enjoy playing the game, they seem to be more willing to spend their money on the game with the money that they earn themselves.
